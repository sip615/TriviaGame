# TriviaGame

This is a simple trivia game, that is timed at 30 seconds. 

When the timer runs out, all answers are calculated. Unanswered questions are considered incorrect. 

The calculated score is displayed in the score box, and correct answers are revealed on the page. 

In addition, the score can also be calculated when the "submit" button is clicked. The submit button contains all the same functionality as the timer running out.
